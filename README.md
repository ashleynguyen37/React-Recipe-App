Specific Intructions on this assignment:
  - The app will display a recipe's name, cuisine, photo, ingredients, preparation instructions and action buttons (edit and delete).
  - You should create at least one additional component that is used by the RecipeList component.
  - The app does not need to match the exact appearance of the mockup, but should be similar and pass the styling tests.
  - You should add handlers and other attributes to the starter code as needed

To create a recipe entry:
  - There are input fields for the name of the dish, the cuisine it belongs to, the URL of the photo, and input areas for the list of ingredients and preparation steps.

To read and display the list of recipes, there is a table structure, each recipe should display: 
  - name, cuisine, photo, ingredients, preparation, and a delete button
